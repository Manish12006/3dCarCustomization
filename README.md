## Project Overview

The 3D Car Customization Web App provides a real-time 3D experience where users can explore and customize a car model inside a web browser. The application demonstrates advanced WebGL rendering techniques combined with modern frontend development.

A Porsche car model was textured, optimized, and exported from Maya as a GLB file and integrated into a React-based 3D scene for smooth performance and realistic visuals.
